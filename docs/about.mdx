# Who am I?

I am a software engineer based in London, UK.

# How is this website built?

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

It uses the App Router and static generation to render pages at build-time.

Styling is implemented with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and a small set of reusable UI components.

The codebase is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

# Why am I doing this?

I have no specific goals in mind. I like to program, and explaining topics helps reinforce what I've learnt. I particularly enjoy functional programming and type safety, so expect to see most topics revolve around that.
