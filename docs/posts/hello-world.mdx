I have decided to create a blog for two reasons:

1. I have a certain creative itch I'm yearning to scratch
2. I want to explore new technology whilst doing so

Hence this blog is born.

I have no set schedule, nor do I have a plan of what I'm going to talk about. But its central theme will be around programming.

Enjoy the ride!
